### Project Overview
This project focuses on statistical analysis of the variables strongly associated with the development of diabetes and building a machine learning model to predict its onset in patients. The goal is to enhance early detection and intervention strategies through data-driven insights. This project builds on my Low Birth Weight and Preterm Delivery Analysis and Prediction projects
### The Big Picture
Developing countries such as Ghana are now digitalizing and accumulating vast amounts of patient data in the form of electronic health records, EHR. Analyzing this data will go a long way in allowing doctors to make quick decisions and more easily identify patients at increased risk of developing diabetes. This can allow for a quicker response, and lower the chances of error through oversight.
### Methodology
* ### Feature Selection: 
I conducted chi-square analysis and independent t-tests to identify features significantly correlated with diabetes, helping to isolate key variables influencing disease onset.
* ### Model Development: 
I implemented multiple classification algorithms to predict diabetes, ultimately finding that the RandomForestClassifier yielded the best performance.
* ### Model Optimization: 
After fine-tuning the classifier, I achieved an accuracy score of 79.54%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting diabetes onset based on the selected features.
### Key Accomplishments
* Successfully identified significant variables associated with diabetes development using statistical analyses.
* Developed a robust machine learning model with an accuracy of 79.54%, facilitating improved early detection of diabetes in patients.
